# Stock-Analysis

# Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to compare the performances of various stocks over time. We are able to input the year and see the total volume and return of the stocks for the given year.

## Code Refactoring and Stock Performance

When completing this analysis and refactoring the code, the script runs much faster with the updated version. From the un-refactored code, the run times were essentially 3.90 seconds for each year. With the refactored code, both years ran under 0.2 seconds. Stock performance changed drastically from 2017 going into 2018. In 2017, all but one stock had a positive return. Conversely, in 2018, there were only 2 stocks that returned a positive return (ENPH and RUN). This is very interesting because it shows how volitle the market can be with one year as a good year, and the next not.

## Summary

Code refactoring has multiple advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of refactoring your code, is that you are improving the performance and removing any errors or bugs in the code for optimization purposes. One disadvantage to refactoring your code, is that you are now opening up the code to new errors or bugs by intorducing new code. There is a fine line when it comes to refactoring, and as the programmer, you must navigate it accordingly. 

These advantages and disadvantages worked into this analysis by making the code run faster, but also having more lines of code to increase the chances for errors.
